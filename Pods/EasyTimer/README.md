#####Natural language syntax for an easy way to use `NSTimer` in Swift for delaying code or repeating code.

Heavily influenced by [SwiftyTimer](https://github.com/radex/SwiftyTimer) - Author: [Radek Pietruszewski (radex)](https://github.com/radex)

## Installation

#### Manually
Add the files in the 'Sources' folder to your project and you will be ready to go!

#### CocoaPods
Coming soon.

#### Carthage
Coming soon.

## Usage

All EasyTimer functions are called upon a NSTimerInterval, which can be represented ruby style.
```swift
1.millisecond
1.3.millisecond
2.second
2.4.second
3.minute
3.5.minute
4.hour
4.6.hour
5.day
5.7.day
```

You can easily schedule three types of timers (repeating, repeating with delay, and delay) - Each of these will return a new NSTimer instance

Schedule a timer that will repeat and call block immediately
```swift
// Will repeat code in block every 2 seconds starting immediately
2.second.interval {
    print("Repeat immediately!")
}

// or with timer passed to the block
2.second.interval { (timer: NSTimer) -> Void in
    print("Repeat immediately! Do something with timer.")
}
```

Schedule a timer that will repeat and call block after time interval delay
```swift
// Will repeat code in block every 2 seconds after a 2 second delay
2.second.delayedInterval {
    print("Repeat after delay!")
}

// or with timer passed to the block
2.second.delayedInterval { (timer: NSTimer) -> Void in
    print("Repeat after delay! Do something with timer.")
}
```

Schedule a timer that will call block once after time interval
```swift
// Will execute code in block once after 2 second delay
2.second.delay {
    print("Delay ended!")
}

// or with timer passed to the block
2.second.delay { (timer: NSTimer) -> Void in
    print("Delay ended! Do something with timer.")
}
```

You can also choose to create a timer and start it later using `timer(repeats:, delays:)` which will return a newly created NSTimer instance

```swift
let timer = 3.minute.timer(repeats: true, delays: true) {
    print("Do something.")
}

// or with timer passed to the block
let timer = 3.minute.timer(repeats: true, delays: true) { (timer: NSTimer) -> Void in
    print("Do something with timer.")
}
```

Call `start()` to schedule timers created using `timer(repeats:, delays:)`. You can optionally pass the run loop and run loop modes:

```swift
timer.start()
timer.start(modes: NSDefaultRunLoopMode, NSEventTrackingRunLoopMode)
```

Call `stop()` to invalidate timers and remove them from the run loop. You can optionally pass the run loop and run loop modes:

```swift
timer.stop()
timer.stop(modes: NSDefaultRunLoopMode, NSEventTrackingRunLoopMode)
```
